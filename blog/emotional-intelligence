        <h4>What is emotional intelligence?</h4>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is basically being aware of, understanding and
          managing emotions, not just of yourself but others, and is seemingly
          split into 5 different areas: self-awareness, self-regulation,
          motivation, empathy, and social skills. by understanding your own
          emotions and being able to regulate them, you can use that information
          to guide your thinking and behavior for the better. emotional
          intelligence seems to be a model for basically understanding emotions
          and being present and feeling them, but not giving in to the emotion.
          By realising you are feeling “anger” you can identify how your mind
          and body feels as it starts and try to quell it, where as giving in to
          the emotion would be to have outbursts or short tempered with people.
          The realisation of your emotions gives you the skill to deal with
          them.

        <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
        <p>
          the simplest and most common answer I can find is that EQ is focused
          on social and emotional competency while IQ is focused on academic and
          reasoning competency. EQ is based around your ability in sensing
          emotion in yourself and others and how you guide that behaviour, while
          IQ is about your analytical thought. Someone with very high IQ but low
          EQ would be able to filter irrelevent information and solve math
          challenges, but find it hard to assess their own emotions when theyre
          frustrated.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
        <p>
          EQ is important in a lot of ways but i think the most relevant to me
          is to be able to regulate my reaction to emotions. I tend to get very
          caught in emotions so by practicing EQ I can gain the ability to catch
          myself feeling emotional and if it is negative begin to remedy it.
          another important aspect is it seems like an incredible tool for
          leaders; to be able to recognise their employees emotions, listen
          consciously, and have empathy. EQ seems like a tool that will affect
          so much of your life, and have a huge positive effect in many ways,
          while IQ’s scope seems a lot more limited and not as life changing.

        <h4>Overall thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          EQ seems to be a really great collection of ideas I'm excited to have
          a go at. not only will it have a great effect on my coding and larger
          work-life, but also be a really great way to deal with my emotional
          stability and problems stemming from depression. I immediatly
          downloaded "Search inside yourself" and plan to embrace EQ and
          mindfulness practises as dilligintly as I can.
