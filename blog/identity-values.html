            is useful, but it was a good excercise in trying to look at myself
            and what makes me 'me'

        <h3>my ramblings on my key values</h3>
        <p>
          friendship/kindness - one of the things that got me through a lot of
          the hardest things in my life was having true friends that were there
          not just when i was a fun person to be around but when i sucked. After
          having that for myself i always do the same and will I’ve seen how
          much just being a little kind to someone can affect their life, and
          most of the time its so easy to be kind rather than harsh.
        </p>

        <p>
          fairness& acceptance - treating all people the same is a big thing for
          me, and came up often in online quizzes. I really dislike the idea of
          bias affecting someones judgments, and showing preferential treatment
          because of outside factors or existing connections. I strongly believe
          as humans we need to accept people for their differences and treat
          everyone with the same level of respect and love you would expect.
        </p>

        <p>
          forgiveness - humans make a lot of mistakes and i believe you can
          learn, move on and be better through forgiveness. I dont mean this in
          a christian sense but in the sense that if someone has wronged me,
          i’ll always give them the chance to talk and make it better rather
          than writing them off and moving on. Some of the best friends and
          lessons ive learnt have came from this
        </p>

        <p>
          family - in the last few years I’ve become much more close with my
          family, including extended. it made me feel almost guilty how i had
          not been there for most of my life. now i can say family is one of the
          first things that come to mind when i think of my values, i will
          always be there when my family needs me and wouldnt feel right not
          being able to be in touch with them. They give me a sense of safety by
          knowing that no matter what happens I will always have my family to
          love and support me.
        </p>

        <h4>my ramblings on my identity</h4>

        <p>
          the biggest identity former for me is my family. The traits they
          demonstrated in my childhood have definatly rubbed off on me, the most
          noticable being acceptance. both but in particular my father was made
          to pursue the career theyre parents wanted, and it really messed with
          him for a long time, so when they had children of their own it was
          really important to be accepting and encouraging of what they want to
          do and not try to lead or be in control of their childrens life, and
          this really rubbed off on me; I’ll always accept people for who they
          are and what they want to do (as long as their not hurting anyone)
        </p>

        <p>
          a lot of my identity comes from my recovery from depression, one of
          the first things i had to do was be open and talk about everything,
          which was very hard as i was the type to bottle things up and keep the
          anger and frustration all to myself. But by being open it really
          started all the positive stuff happening and it felt really good to
          let it out, so now im definatly a very open person and dont feel shy
          about sharing personal things or things that might make me look weak
          or dumb.
        </p>

        <p>
          one of the reccuring things people said about me is im one of the best
          people to be around, and always will make them laugh and feel included
          and wanted socially, so i believe another key things about my identity
          is radical inclusion - meaning that if you want to be involved or
          around something then to always try to include them and give them a
          go. I was always a naturally shy person and when i first started going
          to festivals (kiwiburn primarly) one of the key tenants was “radical
          self-inclusion”. Because of this i was invited into so many cool
          circles of people and activities i would have never had the courage to
          step into myself, but it has been so good for me.

        <h3>Here is where I answered the questions from the previous sprint</h3>

        <h4>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          one situation i found very hard was having to ask a good friend to
          move out of our flat, because they were really disruptive of other
          flatmates, messy, and was bad at paying bills on time. I felt very
          conflicted because this was a person i had a long history with and had
          vouched for, but things were clearly not working. i had to weigh up
          offending or possibly losing a close friend, and making my home life
          extremely uncomfortable. the decision i made was to ask the flatmate
          to leave, because i knew it was the correct decision; my flatmate
          wasnt in a good place and was causing harm to others, and by asking
          him to leave i knew he would return to his family home which would be
          a way to potentially get healthier. If i allowed him to stay he most
          likely would have kept up his negative behaviour.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Maori culture has begun to influence me greatly in the last few years,
          especially the emphasis on family and extended community. I had never
          been someone to be connected to people e.g i never introduced myself
          to my neighbors. But thru seeing how happy and connected, and how much
          it helps with day to day life i really strive to live like this and be
          more connected to those around me.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I Think my biggest strength when it comes to learning is my creativity
          & teamwork. I've always been a creative person who finds novel ways to
          conceptualise things and this comes in handy with coding, having to
          constantly learn new things that can be challenging to understand. I'm
          a big team player and often happier to be a great team member than a
          leader, and I believe this will be a big asset during study. Not only
          with working with other students and being able to support them, but
          since I'm great at following it will come in handy with following my
          tutors and the curriculim.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          the biggest limitation i have is my depressive mindset; i hate to
          mention depression so much but its really shaped so much of my life in
          the last 8 years or so. I still struggle with a very self-defeating
          mindset, and can tend to give up on something before even trying, and
          slowly spiralling that into thinking really negatively about myself. I
          can see it being a potential problem that when im working on a problem
          that im very stuck on, instead of asking for help (for fear of looking
          dumb) i will just retreat and hide to myself, and tell myself i
          shouldnt be doing this course or i made the wrong decision trying to
          return to coding. I know now this is the wrong mindset but it still
          pesters me sometimes especially in emotionally draining moments.
          another limitation is my lack of self discipline, which i believe
          comes from my stagnant life over the last 6 years. I havnt had to wake
          up at a certain time, or be anywhere, and havnt had to do things i
          didnt want to. as a result of that my brain is very lazy and i need to
          work extra hard to make myself active.

        <h4>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I often avoid conflict so it was quite hard to think of an example for
          this, but one could be during my old job there was often tension
          around who got which shift. The tension around shifts was so much that
          the manager left them to be decided on by staff because anytime they
          assigned shifts the staff would be unhappy. One strategy I tried when
          we were delegating shifts would be to identify the "best" shifts and
          give one to each member, and the "worst" shifts which I would try to
          get each member to take one. This is my attempt to be as fair as
          possible and is how I often try to resolve conflict. A lot of the time
          this was mostly effective, there would always be at least one person
          not happy with the outcome but I feel that is a lot less than if it
          was "first come first serve" Another strategy could be to rotate
          picking, so each week one person would get priority over picking their
          shifts. This could work well sometimes but as each person might have
          different commitments from week to week I think my strategy works best
          as it allows for more flexibility. If i was to go back in time and
          re-do this situation I would use a similiar strategy of being as fair
          as possible by evenly distributing the "good" and "bad" shifts, but
          maybe taking into consideration other things like how much money do
          people need to make that week etc
