        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Wh훮 is about approaching your health & wellbeing from
          multiple areas, and thinking of them as the pillars of your home. You
          need to have multiple strong walls or pillars to keep the whare
          standing just as you do to keep yourself in good health.

          The activities I've listed in my table have often been things I've
          been trying to do for a long time, so hopefully writing them down will
          add more commitment to them.
        </p>

        <table>
          <!-- <tr>
            <th>Wall</th>
            <th>Activity</th>
          </tr> -->
          <tr>
            <td>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</td>
            <td>Taha Wh훮nau (Family Wellbeing)</td>
            <td>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</td>
            <td>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</td>
            <td>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Going for a run or walk once a day</td>
            <td>Calling a family member daily</td>
            <td>doing at least one meditation on the headspace app</td>
            <td>express gratitude for where I am each morning</td>
            <td>Swim in the sea once a week</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
          Although these are small activities I know sticking to them will do
          nothing but be positive for my life, which is really important for me
          to remember when I dont feel the drive to do anything.
