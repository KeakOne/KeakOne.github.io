        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>
          I'm hoping to get back into life and pick up from where i left off a
          few years ago. Apart from helping get my life in order I want to find
          employment somewhere I like and not just because they would hire me.
          Beyond that if I make any impact at Dev academy it would be nice to be
          an example that you can come back from big challenges in your life,
          and if things dont work out the first time it doesnt mean youve
          failed.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h4>

        <p>
          My view of my strengths and limitations has not changed much, I still
          believe my main strengths are social intelligence and teamwork, and my
          main limitations are motivation and managing my depressive tendancies.
          One other strength I've found through foundations is I have a good
          knowledge of coding and have been able to help some other students
          when we've been talking about our sprints or things we're stuck on in
          terms of talking through logic or trying to find the fault in their
          code, so I'm hoping i can become more helpful which will not only be
          handy to students, but also re-enforce skills and best of all make me
          a more employable person.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h4>

        <p>
          I mentioned it previously but managing my deppresive tendancies will
          be the hardest, because it drips into many factors of life. It could
          potentially make me "give up" and not try as hard as i can, or getting
          the most out of the EDA experience. I am slightly worried about this
          but I know I'm capable of doing this and coming out the other end fine
          now, but once it starts and im in the pressure of it all I could fall
          apart. I'm determined to not have this happen by keeping it present in
          my mind that by doing this and trying as hard as i can I will be
          taking steps to directly beat my deppresive tendancies and form a
          healthier life.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>

        <p>
          I would love to improve my leadership/managerial skills first. I've
          always shyed away from being a leader and taking charge on projects or
          being the leader of a group, not because i wasnt able to but because
          I'm too shy or scared of the responsibility. The other skill I want to
          improve is my motivation, or maybe even more so my "hustle" - the
          ability to be excited to get out of bed early, and eager to approach
          challenges, and do everything possible to make things happen. I've
          been a very stagnant person for a long time so I'm hoping the
          demanding, fast-pace nature of bootcamp will spur this motivation out
          of me.
        </p>

        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>

        <p>
          My expectation are that the bootcamp team show true interest in
          helping students while its work hours. This means just being really
          present and valueing the students time and money as if it were their
          own. I think its important to make sure communication is really good
          as well so its clear what we are working on, what the goals are etc.
          Another important goal would be to have some understanding of
          individual students problems and be understanding, not in a
          hand-holding way but just recognising particular students are
          struggling and prioritising helping them if other students are ok to
          work by themselves.
        </p>

        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>

        <p>
          I expect myself to step-up and be able to be in time for every class,
          and also to make an effort to be in campus as much as i can. I also
          expect myself to not coast if im comfortable with the work, but to
          take on the stretch challenges. I expect myself to not cave-in to my
          mind playing tricks and perservere through hard times, with the
          understanding that once I've got through I'll be stronger and better
          for it. I expect myself to keep my end-goal in mind, and even after
          bootcamp to keep the same work ethic in creating my portfolio,
          applying for jobs, coming up with cool personal projects for as long
          as it takes until I have that job I want.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help
          in a timely way?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I'm going to commit to asking for help when i need it and have given
          an honest effort to something. I've held myself back in many aspects
          of life by not asking for help and retreating and staying silent so
          i'm not going to do it this time. I'm going to keep other students in
          mind and use my social awareness to make a call on if someone else
          requires more assistance than me, and be willing to wait for someone
          who is struggling more than myself. Managing the workload will be
          challenging but i believe by staying communicative with the tutors and
          putting in more than the minumum time requirements while being fully
          present will give me enough to complete the workload.
        </p>

        <h3>Below is my earlier learning plan</h3>

        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to simply find employment at a place I'm happy to
          be a part of. A large part of my adult life I have not had a full-time
          job, and its always made me have a very bad sense of self-worth.
          Through my depression I withdrew from life a lot which didnt help with
          job prospects, and left large gaps in my CV. My goal is to finally
          break forgiveness of my stagnation and get into the world as a
          productive, working, and happy person.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          My strengths are creativity,teamwork and social intelligence. I'm very
          good at working as a team and using my social intelligence to see How
          people are really feeling, or what I need to change about myself to
          work better in this certain group/situation. My biggest limitation is
          my motivation, which stems from years of inactivity. Some days I find
          even the smallest things really challenging, and I do worry that this
          will happen during the course. I have a tendancy to give up and
          retreat when im feeling overwhelmed which im really trying to correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another limitation to learning will be managing my depression
          throughout the course. Although I'm a lot better now than only a
          short-time ago, I still have a lot of the depressive tendancies; To
          only focus on the negative, feel that I'm not good enough, be scared
          of trying because I've convinced myself I'll already fail. Thoughts
          like this are extremely toxic to learning and its important I remember
          everyone is here to help me and I'm doing this course to get a
          positive outcome. Its ok if i struggle or feel overwhelmed as thats
          completely natural, I just need to work hard to make sure it doesnt
          control me.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would love to see my routine,motivation, and just the ability to
          work hard improve. All of these are important to being an adult and I
          just havnt developed them enough due to my past. I know 3 months is a
          very short time but If i can at least get these skills going during
          study I will be in a good place to keep them going.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will manage my workload productively by actively participating and
          being present at team meetings and classes. I will always do my best
          to pay attention and be present during school hours, and conduct
          myself proffesionally with staff and students alike. Its important to
          me to not cause distress to anyone by either what I say or how I act,
          and I intend everyone to feel safe around me. When things are becoming
          stressfull, or work is building up and starting to get to me I will
          communicate that with my co-ordinator and follow their advice, as well
          as keep working and not give up on myself!
        </p>

        <h4>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will make sure to actively ask for help when I need it from the
          tutors and my other students. Depending on the help required will
          dictate who I ask first. For smaller problems such as not being able
          to debug a piece of code, I will first talk to other students, but for
          bigger problems such as falling behind or becoming overwhelmed I will
          seek help from the tutors.
        </p>

        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to honestly listen when I have a
          problem, and do their best to help. i dont expect to be personally
          guided to find answers but i do expect honest help that can lead me to
          the correct answers. Another expectation I have is that their will be
          understanding during times of extreme stress, although it might not
          happen to me it is nice to think that the staff will be able to help
          someone find a way through their struggles, and give them some steps
          to continue working.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things
        </h4>
        <p>
          I currently do not have any other commitments, the only thing I have
          that can interfere with learning is I am planning to move house during
          February, which could take two days meaning I may fall behind
          temporarily.
