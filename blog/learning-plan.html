        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway</h4>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to simply find employment at a place I'm happy to
          be a part of. A large part of my adult life I have not had a full-time
          job, and its always made me have a very bad sense of self-worth.
          Through my depression I withdrew from life a lot which didnt help with
          job prospects, and left large gaps in my CV. My goal is to finally
          break forgiveness of my stagnation and get into the world as a
          productive, working, and happy person.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          My strengths are creativity,teamwork and social intelligence. I'm very
          good at working as a team and using my social intelligence to see How
          people are really feeling, or what I need to change about myself to
          work better in this certain group/situation. My biggest limitation is
          my motivation, which stems from years of inactivity. Some days I find
          even the smallest things really challenging, and I do worry that this
          will happen during the course. I have a tendancy to give up and
          retreat when im feeling overwhelmed which im really trying to correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another limitation to learning will be managing my depression
          throughout the course. Although I'm a lot better now than only a
          short-time ago, I still have a lot of the depressive tendancies; To
          only focus on the negative, feel that I'm not good enough, be scared
          of trying because I've convinced myself I'll already fail. Thoughts
          like this are extremely toxic to learning and its important I remember
          everyone is here to help me and I'm doing this course to get a
          positive outcome. Its ok if i struggle or feel overwhelmed as thats
          completely natural, I just need to work hard to make sure it doesnt
          control me.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would love to see my routine,motivation, and just the ability to
          work hard improve. All of these are important to being an adult and I
          just havnt developed them enough due to my past. I know 3 months is a
          very short time but If i can at least get these skills going during
          study I will be in a good place to keep them going.
        </p>

        <h4>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will manage my workload productively by actively participating and
          being present at team meetings and classes. I will always do my best
          to pay attention and be present during school hours, and conduct
          myself proffesionally with staff and students alike. Its important to
          me to not cause distress to anyone by either what I say or how I act,
          and I intend everyone to feel safe around me. When things are becoming
          stressfull, or work is building up and starting to get to me I will
          communicate that with my co-ordinator and follow their advice, as well
          as keep working and not give up on myself!
        </p>

        <h4>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will make sure to actively ask for help when I need it from the
          tutors and my other students. Depending on the help required will
          dictate who I ask first. For smaller problems such as not being able
          to debug a piece of code, I will first talk to other students, but for
          bigger problems such as falling behind or becoming overwhelmed I will
          seek help from the tutors.
        </p>

        <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to honestly listen when I have a
          problem, and do their best to help. i dont expect to be personally
          guided to find answers but i do expect honest help that can lead me to
          the correct answers. Another expectation I have is that their will be
          understanding during times of extreme stress, although it might not
          happen to me it is nice to think that the staff will be able to help
          someone find a way through their struggles, and give them some steps
          to continue working.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things
        </h4>
        <p>
          I currently do not have any other commitments, the only thing I have
          that can interfere with learning is I am planning to move house during
          February, which could take two days meaning I may fall behind
          temporarily.
