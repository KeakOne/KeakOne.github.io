        <h3>1 February 2024</h3>

        <h3>Being blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <h4>what was the simple problem?</h4>
        <p>
          I was trying to use the .join() method and it was giving me errors,
          saying it is not a method
        </p>

        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          the first thing I did was read the documentation,as I thought i was
          using the wrong syntax. after seeing I was using it correctly i
          figured there was something unexpected happening in my code so I
          started to console.log at different points to find irregularities
          before trying to use the .join() and I found the problem was .join()
          can only be used on an array and i was trying to use it on a string.
        </p>

        <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          I wasnt too stressed with this problem as I knew it was something
          small but it was frustrating as I just couldnt find the problem for a
          while, but i knew it was something easy to fix.
        </p>

        <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          The main thing I learnt was to always check data types! especially
          when using methods as they often can only be applied to certain data
          types.
        </p>

        <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>

        <h4>what was the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          The capitalize excercise in 5-builtin-methods of the javascript Katas.
          I had a good idea of what to do and quite quickly had most of the
          function written, but became blocked when data wasnt being sent to
          where I thought it would be. I did some console logging and reading
          how other people solved similiar problems online but this only
          resulted in me questioning my own code and becoming confused. I took a
          break and did a 10min mindfullness because I felt i had been looking
          at code too much to the point it was becoming detrimental. After
          returning I contacted one of the tutors to get some help and they were
          able to show me where I was going wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this doesnt seem "elegant" I was happy I didnt stress too
          much, and I was able to ask for help quickly rather than trying to
          solve it myself and wasting time which I tend to do too much!
        </p>

        <h4>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h4>
        <p>
          I wrote some pseudocode, did a lot of console logging, googling and
          also just trying things. Ultimately asking a coach for help solved it.
        </p>

        <h4>how did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
        <p>
          Rather frustrated as I went from being confident in solving the
          problem to completely lost. I'm still getting used to feeling a
          healthy level of frustration or uknowing when working through things
          so I think this was good to be able to feel a little bit of stress but
          to continue working through it.
        </p>

        <h4>what did you learn?</h4>
        <p>
          I learnt that before jumping in (even if im feeling confident) its
          really helpful to map out what you want to achieve in the code with
          pseudocode. It gives you time to think things through instead of
          jumping in and running into problems. The main thing I learnt is to
          not hesitate to ask for help, which I've always had a problem with.
          The coaches are there to help and it doesnt do me any favors to be
          sitting trying to work through something cluelessly after a long time
          doing my best to figure it out.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
          techniques/processes
        </h3>
        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty confident in pseudocode but I need to use it more! I tend
          to use it only when I'm really struggling instead of as a tool to plan
          out my code
        </p>

        <h4>Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          I'm confident in just jumping in and trying stuff, but I now always
          make sure I can get things back to the last "best" state. I've tried
          stuff before and then forgotten what the code looked like before I
          started throwing random instructions at it, and havnt been able to get
          it back to what I want even with command Z
        </p>

        <h4>Rubber Ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          This is probably my least practiced method so I'm not too confident at
          it. I think subconsciously I get embarrassed by the idea of talking to
          myself so I dont use it as much as I should. I can see how it would be
          useful as it lets you take a step back from the screen and work
          through something in plain terms
        </p>

        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          This and console logging are the first thing I try to do if something
          isnt working. By reading the error messages during the javascript
          kata's it was a big help, and also the error messages in the console
          if i'm working in the browser.
        </p>

        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
          My personal fav! I love console logging because it lets you get a
          snapshot of almost anything at anytime in your code. As long as you
          can figure out what you should be looking at console logging is great.
          I have confidence in using this method, the only problem I've had is
          when you get functions inside on functions inside of functions I
          sometimes place my console logs at the wrong point.
        </p>

        <h4>googling</h4>
        <p>
          I'm pretty confident in terms of using the correct terms, but I do
          have trouble determining what sites/info are "good". I know the main
          sites for programming info but outside of them I feel it's hard to
          distinguish good from bad advice, as lots of online resources are
          quite old and could be out of date, or just people not giving correct
          info like i see sometimes on stackoverflow.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          I personally struggle with this one, as I have this feeling of
          annoying people when they want to work on their own stuff. I think its
          a hangover from traditional learning, but i always assume other
          students are struggling too and wouldnt have time to help. I need to
          change this as if someone can help me that means they understand it
          and i'm not inconveniencing them at all, perhaps even solidifying
          their knowledge in what theyre helping me with.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          similiar to asking peers I'm not too confident at this but am much
          better after this sprint. Before sprint 4 I could work through things
          by myself pretty fast, but this week I had many excercises I was very
          lost on so I had to ask coaches a lot more. The more i do it the more
          comfortable I feel so I think by the time bootcamp arrives I wont
          hesitate to ask for help.
        </p>

        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
        <p>
          I do a slightly lazy version of reflection most days, I'll look over
          what challenges I've completed and try to see where I started to go
          wrong, or what I could have done to make things easier on myself. to
          improve this reflection I should be writing things down, or maybe
          making notes in my code that highlight key things to reflect on e.g
          "your indentation made things hard to read which made you miss the
          closing bracket"
        </p>

        <h3>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My reluctance to ask for help comes mostly from feeling like im
          annoying someone, or I should be able to do this task myself so I
          shouldnt be asking for help. I think the main thing I need to change
          is my perception that asking for help is a "dumb" thing to do, or is
          admitting defeat, when in reality if I've truly tried my best and am
          still stuck I'm just doing the next logical step to learn. I'm not
          helping anyone by trying to google and tinker with code for hours, im
          only confusing and slowing down my own learning.
