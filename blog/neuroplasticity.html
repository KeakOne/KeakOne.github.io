        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

        <h4>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h4>
        <p>
          understanding neuroplaticity can be a huge benefit for people trying
          to learn new things or change their habits. "rewiring" th brain is
          simply creating new synaptic connections, which it normally does, but
          by understanding neuroplasticity and the techniques that enhance it
          you can make these connections faster. You can also aid in healing
          from trauma, but I feel the best use of neuroplasticity for me
          personally will be to engage with and pick up the huge amount of
          skills being taught during EDA.
        </p>

        <h4>
          -Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit
        </h4>
        <p>
          the biggest thing I need to do to improve my brains neuroplasticity is
          exercise; I don't currently do much exercise and need to improve this.
          The other main principle that I can apply easier is meditation, I'm
          more experienced and have some a better grasp on applying meditation.
          One of the main principles of neuroplasticity is repetition, which I
          think will naturally happen during course but i will always keep this
          mind when revising code.
        </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>
          exercise, good sleep, meditation, avoid comfortable repetition, and
          also forming new skills like languages or painting and drawing are a
          great help. It seems to be a core tenant to push your brain to have
          new experiences and repeat the actions of skills you want to retain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way of increasing neuroplasticity is by doing your regular
          routine slightly different e.g brushing your teeth with the opposite
          hand, going a different direction on your commute or even switching
          hands for daily tasks can all help with working new neural pathways.
          Things like puzzles and chess are very good as well.

          I found

            >this link</a

          had really good explanations and excercises you can do to increase
          neuroplasticity
        </p>

        <h4>Discuss what growth mindset is and why it is relevant</h4>
        <p>
          growth mindset is a way of viewing things in that challenges and
          setbacks are not seen as limiting or bad, but as a growth potential
          and understanding that your skills are not set in stone. Someone with
          a fixed mindset would take criticism personally and take their
          struggles to heart, seeing themselves as dumb. It's relevant to take
          on a growth mindset as it will greatly help dealing with the amount of
          work we will encounter in EDA.
        </p>

        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
        <p>
          I realised I need to focus on exercise more, and it will have a much
          bigger impact on my life than just physically. From everything i read
          exercise greatly increases neuroplasticity and your health in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          another realisation I had was that I need to be much more pro-active
          in applying teachings, its simply not going to be enough to be aware
          of these skills but I need to be actively applying them and making the
          effort to experience new things and build new connections in my brain.
          I feel that sometimes my laziness gets the best of me and its going to
          be integral to my success to overcome that.
        </p>

        <h4>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The main way will be just reminding myself during times of duress that
          it's perfectly ok to be feel overwhelmed, and in the end it's good as
          im forming new neural connections. Reminding myself that feeling
          overwhelmed with work is much better than being lazy and continuing
          with my non-challenging life is far worse than the duress I'm
          currently going through, to achieve a much better life.

          <a href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/">this article</a> had
          some really good practical tips and thoughts about how to change your
          mindset. I liked the section "The power of...yet"
