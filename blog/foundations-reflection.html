        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>
          1 - The first thing that comes to mind is my ego holding me back in
          terms of asking for help. I've always been very embarrassed or
          hesitant to ask for help, but i didnt realise it was related to ego. I
          thought it was just embarrasment for embarrasment sake, but it was
          actually because i think of asking for help as a sign of being dumb or
          not meeting my own expectations which hurts my ego, even uknowingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          2 - I learnt that my ego is a huge part of what has been holding me
          back, I put a lot of weight of expectations on myself and constantly
          compare myself to others or where i think I should be in my life at
          this point. I didnt really accept that self-expectations were a part
          of ego, but it ultimately is as its a projection of yourself or what
          you think of yourself. By always thinking I am doing a bad job by
          comparison I'm just holding myself down and reducing any
          accomplishments I've made.
        </p>

        <p>
          3 - I learnt that the ego is not only just when you think you are
          better than other people, but Its something we also used to protect
          ourselves. Throughout my depression I always told myself I wasnt
          smart, motivated or lots of other negative things, but now framing it
          through ego I was doing this to try protect myself from having a go
          and maybe failing. My ego was working against me and making me not see
          things clearly, and telling me that its not worth trying because
          you'll fail anyway, so save yourself that pain and just dont try,
          which is ultimately what led to me stalling in life for so many years.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>

        <p>
          All of these roles help you be a better, healthier coder and person
          but I think the main purpose is to make people work better together.
          By having empathy you can feel a lot more for your co-workers and be
          more aware of when theyre not feeling well or up to a task. By being
          self-aware you can manage how you interact with people to bring the
          best of yourself, and be aware of what works for you and what doesnt
          in a collaborative setting. You can use the knowledge you have of
          yourself to lay out the best road for yourself around others.
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
          What suprised me was so many of the things I've wanted to learn more
          about, or start practising in my own life was a part of the core
          curriculim. Things like growth mindset, mindfullness, meditation,
          neuroplasticity had all been talked about with me before during
          therapy and had been enjoyable when i had put them into practise, but
          I had not stayed vigilant. Seeing these aspects in the curriculim made
          me realise i need to continue practising and exploring these topics
          not just for the previous reasons but for now also being a healthy
          coder in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
          The hardest part was reaching out and interacting with other people,
          like in the listening and looping excercise. I'm quite a reserved
          person so I find it hard to talk to people I've never met in real life
          before. It was also challenging to keep some of the ideas from core
          learning in my head when things are stressfull or I'm under a time
          constraint, I seem to just be less vigilant and not think of using the
          core practises at times like that.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I believe there is a heavy focus on core learning because the concepts
          taught will carry on well past our time at EDA. If there is research
          and feedback from employers saying these practises are what theyre
          looking for then thats a huge plus, but its also for the well being of
          the individual. Understanding your key values, having empathy,
          approaching challenges with a growth mindset are all things that will
          not only be great for someone in work but in their personal life, and
          help them cope with a lot of the common problems people encounter in
          tech employment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think the amount of time spent is well spent as its shown true that
          investment and time put into these practises, even just small amounts
          of time each day, will greatly improve a persons life overall.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead?
        </h3>

        <p>
          For me it didnt feel like a waste of time because I was seeking more
          than just coding skills with coming to EDA. personally I was looking
          for life skills and a way to bring myself back to a ready state to
          enter the work force after a long time being absent, so because of
          that core has been really important. However If i didnt have much
          pre-existing coding experience and was finding the curriculim
          extremely hard, and questioning if coding was right for me then I
          would feel it is a waste because I want to improve my coding skills so
          much that other things would feel like focusing on the wrong area.
