        <h4>Javascript and how it relates to to HTML & CSS</h4>
        <p>
          Javascript is often thought of as the "action" behind a webpage.
          Meaning that if you fill out a form, click a button, add something to
          a watchlist- all of these things are making little actions happen
          behind the scenes that gives a webpage its interactivity, and thats
          all thanks to Javascript!
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most common analogies for how HTML, CSS & Javascript fit
          together is the human body- skeleton, beauty and the brain. The HTML
          is the strong foundation of a skeleton, it gives space and outlines
          where everything else in the body goes. The CSS is our outward
          appearance, our hairstyle, eye-colour and fashion choices. Javascript
          is the brain; the thinking, the logic, the thing that controls our
          decision making and how we respond to everything.
        </p>

        <h4>Control flow</h4>

        <p>
          In computer programming control flow refers to the order that your
          pieces of code (functions, statements etc) run in. Computers are
          amazing at running instructions on their own, but arent too good at
          making decisions. It's our job as programmers to provide lots of sets
          of instructions to our computer friends, and the conditions for when
          to use each set. having "good" control flow means your code is more
          flexible and readable, and accounts for lots of situations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best analogy I could find is imagining traffic lights. When we
          come to a traffic light there are 3 options(possible sets of
          instructions); green, red or orange light. Each of these lights give
          you the instructions of what to do next to control the flow of
          traffic. This is similiar to programming control flow because its
          putting checks in place to make sure its safe to proceed with your
          code.
        </p>

        <h4>Loops</h4>

        <p>
          Loops are used in programming to repeat an action some number of times
          until they are told to stop. We give them a set of conditions that as
          long as theyre met, they will just keep running and doing whatever
          piece of code we have writtin inside them. as soon as those conditions
          aren't met, the loop will stop. A concrete example of a loop could be
          washing dishes;
        </p>
        <p>
          when we wash dishes we mostly repeat the same cleaning action until we
          run out of dishes to wash, you can imagine the loop running like this;
          1 - check if there are any dirty dishes left, if yes, go to step 2; if
          not you've finished! end the loop. 2 - get the dirty dish and wash it,
          then go back to step 1. In this example you can see how loops are
          ideal for repeating simple actions again and again until you reach an
          ending condition (in this example its running out of dishes).
        </p>

        <h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
        <p>
          The document object model (DOM) is pretty much everything you see
          inside of your browser tab window. It's a big tree of all the objects
          inside that website, and gives javascript a bunch of ways to hook into
          the different parts of a website by interacting with these objects.
        </p>

        <p>
          The DOM gives developers a really easy way to find and make changes to
          parts of the HTML. The simplest way of seeing this in action is by
          "inspecting" elements and temporarily changing them. By right clicking
          and selecting inspect, you pull up the devtools. Right there you
          should see a list of all the HTML, and be able to select elements and
          make small changes, and you will instantly see those applied in the
          DOM! This is always temporary when using devtools but can be permanent
          or more dynamic when using Javascript.
        </p>

          width="600px"
          src="../img/dominteraction.png"
          alt="editing an h1 element"
        />
        <p><em>using devtools to highlight and change the H1</em></p>

        <h4>Arrays & Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Arrays and objects are simply containers used to store data. Arrays
          are more like a simple list, where you have an amount of items within
          them, and to access those items you referance an "index", or what
          number the item you want appears in the list order.
        </p>
        <img width="600px" src="../img/array.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          In the above example, we have an array of three names, and to access
          and assign the correct name to the variable "myName" we simply put the
          index in using square brackets. But wait! theres 3 names in the array,
          but to access the last one we only gave it 2? This is because Arrays
          begin counting at 0! Something that will definatly catch you out in
          the beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Objects are slightly more complicated, but at the end of the day are
          just a way to store information as well. They use key value pairs so
          you can match a name and a value together, making it easier to access
          in the future.
        </p>
        <img width="600px" src="../img/object.png" alt="" />

        <p>
          In the above example I've made a "person" object, and given some keys
          and values to build the properties of this object. At the bottom you
          can see how easy having these key value pairs makes accessing the
          properties, as I can look into the object and pull out properties by
          simply writing "person.firstName" - "person" referancing the object we
          made, and "firstName" representing a property we created.
        </p>

        <h4>Fun-ctions</h4>
        <p>
          I think the simplest definition of a function is a block of code that
          performs a specific task. you write a set of actions that happen when
          the function is "called"(told to run), and everytime you call it, that
          same set of actions happens again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are super useful as they can cut out having to write the
          same code over and over. Let's say in your javascript you constantly
          have to add two strings together, and all throughout your code you've
          written the same thing at multiple times to add strings together. By
          writing a single function that does this once, and then calling it
          when you need to add strings together, You've not only reduced the
          complication of your code, but made it more reusable.
        </p>

        <p>
          By using functions correctly you dont need to write heaps of lines of
          code to do a common task, and make your code more reusable and
          modular!
